## About

Georgia Elections 2026 is a **grassroots organizing hub** built by and for Houston County Democrats. This platform provides progressive voters and organizers with data-driven insights to win in 2026â€”from statewide open seats to local legislative races.

We're building the tools Democratic organizers need: real-time campaign finance tracking, comprehensive candidate profiles, and resources to mobilize effectively. Georgia proved in 2020-2021 that organizing matters. Let's do it again.
